- When man has realised Individualism, he will also realise sympathy and exercise it freely and spontaneously. All sympathy is fine, **but sympathy with suffering is apt to become morbid**. One should sympathise with the entirety of life, not with life’s sores and maladies merely, but with life’s joy and beauty and energy and health and freedom. 
- When man is happy, he is in harmony with himself and his environment. When he live intensely, fully, so without exercising restraint on others, or suffering, and his activities are all pleasurable to him, he will be saner, healthier, more civilised, more himself.  Pleasure is Nature’s test, her sign of approval. 
- Anybody can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature—it requires, in fact, the nature of a true Individualist—to sympathise with a friend’s success, such sympathy is naturally rare, and is also very much stifled by the immoral ideal of uniformity of type and conformity to rule which is so prevalent. While sympathy with joy intensifies the sum of joy in the world, sympathy with pain does not really diminish the amount of pain.  It may make man better able to endure evil, but the evil remains.

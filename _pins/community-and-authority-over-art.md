subject: art and libertarian socialism
object: Oscar Wilde

- The barbarous conception of authority and the recognition of popular authority are fatal. It comes from the natural inability of a community corrupted by authority to understand or appreciate Individualism. In a word, it comes from that monstrous and ignorant thing that is called Public Opinion. 
- one of the results of the extraordinary tyranny of authority is that words are absolutely distorted from their proper and simple meaning, and are used to express the obverse of their right signification

title: selfishness is to make claims upon others
subject: art and libertarian socialism
object: Oscar Wilde

Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live, always aims at creating around it an absolute uniformity of type. And unselfishness is letting other people’s lives alone, not interfering with them. It recognises infinite variety of type as a delightful thing, accepts it, acquiesces in it, enjoys it.  
It is not selfish to think for oneself. A man who does not think for himself does not think at all. For the egotist is he who makes claims upon others, and the Individualist will not desire to do that. It will not give him pleasure.

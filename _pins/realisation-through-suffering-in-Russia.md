subject: art and libertarian socialism

No one who lived in modern Russia could possibly realise his perfection except by pain. A few #Russian-artists have realised themselves in Art; in a fiction that is mediaeval in character, because its dominant note is the realisation of men through suffering. A Russian who lives happily under the present system of government in Russia must either believe that man has no soul, or that, if he has, it is not worth developing.

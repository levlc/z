- real artistic value may not be evident to the spectator at first
- know the delightful emotions of wonder, curiosity, and suspense
- to forget the egotism of ignorance, or the egotism of the information
- The more completely a man can suppress his own silly views over a work of art, his own foolish prejudices, his own absurd ideas of what it should or should not be, the more likely he is to understand and appreciate the work of art in question.
- with temperament capable of receiving, through an imaginative medium, and under imaginative conditions, new and beautiful impressions 
- to realise and to gain an artistic temperament

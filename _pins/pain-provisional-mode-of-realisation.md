title: pain provisional mode of realisation
subject: art and libertarian socialism
object: Oscar Wilde

- The terrible truth that pain is a mode through which man may realise himself exercises a wonderful fascination over the world, it is rarely in the world’s history that its ideal has been one of joy and beauty. 
- The evolution of man is slow. The injustice of men is great. It was necessary that pain should be put forward as a mode of self-realisation. 
- Pain has reference to wrong, unhealthy, unjust surroundings, it is not the ultimate mode of perfection, merely provisional and a protest. When the wrong, and the disease, and the injustice are removed, it will have no further place, it will have done its great work.

- Most people go through their lives in a sort of coarse comfort, like petted animals, without ever realising that they are probably thinking other people’s thoughts, living by other people’s standards, wearing practically what one may call other people’s second-hand clothes, and never being themselves for a single moment
- The one thing that the public dislike is novelty. The vitality and progress of art depend in a large measure on the continual extension of subject-matter, and it is extremely distasteful to the public.
- The public dislike novelty because they are afraid of it. It represents to them a mode of Individualism, an assertion on the part of the artist that he selects his own subject, and treats it as he chooses.
- The arts that have escaped best are the arts in which the public take no interest. Poetry for instance — the public do not read it, and consequently do not influence it.
- A fresh mode of Beauty is absolutely distasteful to the public, and whenever it appears they get angry, and bewildered. When they say a work is grossly unintelligible, they mean that the artist has said or made a beautiful thing that is new; when they describe a work as grossly immoral, they mean that the artist has said or made a beautiful thing that is true. The former expression has reference to style; the latter to subject-matter. 
- The public are all morbid, because the public can never find expression for anything.  The artist is never morbid.  He expresses everything.  He stands outside his subject, and through its medium produces incomparable and artistic effects.

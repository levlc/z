title: journalism supplies insatiable curiosity
subject: art and libertarian socialism

- The public discovered that the pen is mightier than the paving-stone, and can be made as offensive as the brickbat. They at once sought for the journalist, found him, developed him, and made him their industrious and well-paid servant
- The public have an insatiable curiosity to know everything, except what is worth knowing. Journalism, conscious of this, and having tradesman-like habits, supplies their demands.
- Their attacks are very gross, very impertinent, and very contemptible. No artist expects grace from the vulgar mind, or style from the suburban intellect. 
- And it is only fair to state, with regard to modern journalists, that they always apologise to one in private for what they have written against one in public

title: the state as a voluntary association
subject: art and libertarian socialism
object: Oscar Wilde

- There is no such thing as governing mankind, as a wise man once said, there is such a thing as leaving mankind alone. All modes of government are failures. Despotism is unjust to everybody, including the despot, who was probably made for better things. Oligarchies are unjust to the many, and ochlocracies are unjust to the few. Democracy means simply the bludgeoning of the people by the people for the people.
- The State is to be a voluntary association - manufacturer and distributor of necessary commodities, organise labour. The State is to make what is useful.  The individual is to make what is beautiful.
7. the slavery of the machine
- It is mentally and morally injurious to man to do anything in which he does not find pleasure. It is impossible to sweep the streets with mental, moral, or physical dignity.  To sweep it with joy would be appalling. Man is made for something better than disturbing dirt.
- All work of that kind, all unintellectual labour, all monotonous, dull labour, all labour that deals with dreadful things, and involves unpleasant conditions, must be done by machinery.
- The Greeks were quite right that civilisation requires slaves, that unless there are slaves to do the ugly, horrible, uninteresting work, culture and contemplation become almost impossible. Human slavery is wrong, insecure, and demoralising. The future of the world depends on the slavery of the machine.

title: Experience Action and Continuity
subject: experiential learning theory
---
- three ways or actions through which one arrives at knowledge:
	- experience - an action (especially physical) through which knowledge may be guided (intercepted and united) by #continuity and interaction [^IP]
	- thought, action through which ideas develop, inner experimentation
	- communication an action of consideration and revision that adjusts and modifies ideas to the requirements of the conversation to produce an integrated and harmonised response
- #continuity is the underlying idea that permeates pragmatism, that every experience both takes up something from those which have gone before and modifies in some way the quality of those which come after

title: Action and Notions of Inquiry 
subject: experiential learning theory
---
- Peirce viewed inquiry ( #logic ) as any process which resulted in #change from 
	- a state of doubt (a disturbance of the harmony of one’s actions, an uneasy state from which we struggle to free ourselves) 
	- to a state of belief (a state which guides our desires and shapes our actions)
- Dewey’s [^JD] conception of inquiry incorporates the notion of a situation 
	- a particular type of experience is inextricably linked with knowledge and assumes a different meaning from the traditional objective view of knowledge as of information
	- inquiry is a response to one’s experience of doubt, and doubt is attributed to situations (not people), it is an experience - a process of undergoing
	- a process of standing something, he **perceives knowledge as an action**—the processes which transform a problematic situation into a resolved one
	- through the inquiry process, a belief that has become problematic is scrutinised and resolved by taking action, knowledge becomes **a verb—the process of knowing**
- knowing is not something which is imposed from outside **spectator theory of knowing**, but is something that occurs within nature (from the organism)—an act which modifies what previously existed

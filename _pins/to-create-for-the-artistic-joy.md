title: to create for the artistic joy
subject: art and libertarian socialism
object: Oscar Wilde

- The moment that an artist takes notice of what other people want, and tries to supply the demand, he ceases to be an artist, and becomes a dull or an amusing craftsman, an honest or a dishonest tradesman. Becoming too conscious of the public, appealing directly to the sympathies of the public, or by directly mocking at them spoils the work, better left to popular novelists
- Things people say of a man do not alter a man, he is what he is, public opinion is of no value whatsoever. To create not for the artistic joy, but for the amusement of people means to suppress individualism, forget culture, annihilate style, and surrender everything that is valuable.
- The true artist is a man who believes absolutely in himself, because he is absolutely himself, takes no notice whatever of the public, a beautiful work of art is made to please himself.

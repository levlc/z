title: Dewey's Reflective Thinking
subject: experiential learning theory
---
- thinking could mean 
	- simply uncontrolled coursing of ideas in our heads, or the successions of imaginative incidents and episodes hanging together on a continuous thread, having a certain conference, deliberately employed to establish a conclusion
	- it may be characterised but beliefs that are easily accepted very often without awareness of where and for the thoughts were picked up
- reflective thinking is defined by Dewey [^JD] not simply as a sequence of ideas, but a consequenceâ€”a consecutive ordering, each idea determines the next as is proper outcome, while each outcome in turn refers to its predecessors, **the ideas support one another**

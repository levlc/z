- knowledge is continually being appropriated, interacting with our environment, we acquire habits (patterns of probable behaviour unique to each individual) that form the basis of meaning
- interaction is the interplay between what goes on inside body and mind and the external conditions which affect experiences, the situation, living implies to live in a series of situations
